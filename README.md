## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of breast tumors into two categories: malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous). 
It leverages machine learning techniques and a neural network model implemented in Python.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**: The project is primarily coded in Python, a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and extensive libraries.

- **TensorFlow 2.x**: TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, is employed for building and training the neural network.

- **Scikit-Learn 0.24**: Scikit-Learn, a powerful machine learning library, is used for data preprocessing, including feature standardization and dataset splitting.

- **Matplotlib 3.x**: Matplotlib is utilized to create informative visualizations, such as training and validation accuracy/loss plots.

- **Pandas 1.x**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, making it easier to work with structured data.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Scikit-Learn 0.24
- Matplotlib 3.x
- Pandas 1.x

## Description

This project starts by loading the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn, which contains various features related to breast tumor characteristics. It then employs Scikit-Learn's data preprocessing capabilities, including standardization, to prepare the data for machine learning.The core of the project is a neural network model created using TensorFlow's Keras API. The neural network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation, and an output layer designed for binary classification (malignant or benign tumors). The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.

## Dataset used:
